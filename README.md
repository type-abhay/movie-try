# movie-try
My School project for Class 12, I made it with one of classmates.

Objective:
The main objective of the project is to prepare a computerized Movie Ticket Booking and Management System.
This package is useful for booking tickets for customers and maintaining records,
storing and analyzing data for admins. 

Scope:
This is a completely functional program that enables us to book tickets as well as
manage the records mentioned above. One can also view analytics regarding the same.

Disclaimer:
You need to have a MySQL database already made for the storing and managing function to work, and change all the paths to your local device.
The "Movie Rating" graph is made from a CSV, while the other ones are made using the MySQL Database. So for the one with CSV to work you need to have the corresponding CSV file.
